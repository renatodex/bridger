    <h2 data-high=1>Example page</h2>

    <p>
      At this moment, the only bridger available is the jQuery Bridger. If you inspect this source code, you will see that we instantiated a version of this wrapper.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use the Bridge wrapper as you were using jQuery. But not all methods are implemented. There is a lack of funcionality that is not critical at this point. (maybe append/preppend methods are important)
